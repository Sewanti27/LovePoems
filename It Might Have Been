IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

His tender words confuse me,
For the pulsating crimson creature
Has imprisoned my love with medicine for his grieving soul.
As I dive deeper into this endless sea of chatter,
Deformed by the merciless strong waves
Of longing for the tragic calamity that falls upon me
Everytime, he lets me slip right through his fingers.
Now that I have traded my soul for a wreckage,
A wreckage that is claimed as folly by this universe,
I will forever be hypnotised by the notion,
That my existence was never a reliable cure
For the illness of his heart.
